# FizzBuzz

* `Fork` the GitHub repository
* `git add`, `git commit` and` git push` directly on your repository as much you want.
* Open an `Pull request`, you must get a green light on the Travis CI server to validate the exercise!

## Rules

* print out "Fizz" if the integer is a multiple of 3 (and not a multiple of 5)
* print out "Buzz" if the integer is a multiple of 5 (and not a multiple of 3)
* print "FizzBuzz" if the integer is a multiple of 3 and 5
* print the number if the integer is not a multiple of 3 or 5

## Examples

```javascript
fizzbuzz(2) => 2
fizzbuzz(3) => "Fizz"
fizzbuzz(5) => "Buzz"
fizzbuzz(6) => "Fizz"
fizzbuzz(11) => 11
fizzbuzz(30) => "FizzBuzz"
```

## GO, GO, GO!
